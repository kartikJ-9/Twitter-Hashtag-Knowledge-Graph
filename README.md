This hashtag (#9Baje9Minute) was initiated around April 5, 2020 where PM Narendra Modi called out nation to light up diyas at 9 PM for 9 minutes to express solidarity. There were lots of fake news and hype created around that time. Cut to few weeks back, the focus of the hashtag shifted to mocking government. With government exams like RRB being conducted, it became the talk of the town. Rail Mantri, Piyush Goyal was mentioned by a lot of people. The very same hashtag was used to target unemployment.
